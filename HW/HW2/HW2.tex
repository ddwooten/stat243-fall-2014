\subsection{}
The j loop goes through j=1 to j=3. At each itteration of the for loop
we call the function inside of myFuns of j, or myFuns[[j]]. The trick here,
why each myFuns returns 3, is that the function inside of each myFuns part
returns i, and seeing as i is not redefined inside of the current for loop,
R goes looking into the global environment. Here it finds i, and the last value
that i had, and still has, is 3. As such, each call of myFuns calls a function 
which returns i and as such, returns 3.
